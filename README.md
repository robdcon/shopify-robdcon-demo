# Shopify Be.Mac Project

This project is a Shopify store implementation for BeMac Store. It includes the necessary files and configurations to set up and customize the store on Shopify.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.

## Development Process
- Once you have the dependencies installed, run ```npm run start:watch``` to begin development.
- This runs 2 commands concurrently, which will start the build/watch webpack process and run the shopify cli commands.
- When a change is saved to JS or style files, webpack will build the files and update the src folder, which will trigger the Shopify command to sync changes.
- Once you are happy with your changes, commit and push all files, including the build files from src folder to the remote branch.
